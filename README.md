# Extracting-Text-from-Image-using-Azure-Cognitive-Services
Introduction
Welcome to the "Extracting Text from Image using Azure Cognitive Services" project! This project aims to demonstrate how to leverage the power of Azure Cognitive Services to extract text from images with ease. By following this guide, you'll be able to extract text from various types of images, such as scanned documents, photos, and screenshots, using Azure's advanced optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities.

Features
Effortless Text Extraction: Extract text from images without the need for manual transcription or typing.
Multiple Image Formats Supported: Supports a wide range of image formats including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and PDF.
Accurate and Reliable Results: Azure Cognitive Services employs state-of-the-art OCR algorithms to deliver highly accurate and reliable text extraction results.
Language Support: Extract text from images containing multiple languages with built-in language detection and recognition capabilities.
Flexible Integration: Seamlessly integrate Azure Cognitive Services into your applications or workflows using a variety of programming languages and platforms.
